  Key Findings

  Stack: Laravel 11 + PHP 8.2+, PostgreSQL, Redis, TailwindCSS 4.x, Vite. For
  markdown: league/commonmark 2.8+ with security config, wrapped by Prezet for
  full-featured blogging. Comments via lakm/laravel-comments or Giscus. Deploy
  with GitHub Actions.

  Table Stakes: Markdown publishing via git push, post listing, categories/tags,
   RSS feed, responsive design, fast loads (<2s), syntax highlighting, dark
  mode, projects showcase, about page, contact form, SEO meta tags, social
  sharing.

  Watch Out For:
  - Parse markdown once during git-sync, cache HTML aggressively—parsing at
  request time kills performance
  - Configure html_input: 'strip' in CommonMark immediately—prevents XSS attacks
  - Git sync race conditions from concurrent webhooks—use job queues with
  single-worker + file locking
  - Comment spam destroys SEO—multi-layer defense or use Giscus
  - N+1 queries on blog listings—always eager load relationships
  - Lock URL structure before launch—changing canonical URLs damages SEO

  Files: .planning/research/

   GSD ► DEFINING REQUIREMENTS
  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Based on the research, here are the features for a personal blog and portfolio
   platform:

  Content Management & Publishing

  Table stakes:
  - Markdown publishing workflow (write locally, git push = publish)
  - Post listing with pagination (chronological order)
  - Individual post pages with clean reading experience
  - Categories and tags for organization
  - RSS/Atom feed for subscribers
  - Syntax highlighting for code blocks
  - Push-to-deploy automation (GitHub webhooks)

  Differentiators:
  - Git-native workflow (version controlled content, no web CMS needed)
  - Front matter metadata parsing (YAML in markdown files)
  - Draft vs published state management
  - Reading time estimates
  - Series/collections for grouping related posts

  Research notes: The git-based workflow is your core differentiator. Most
  competitors (Ghost, Dev.to) use web editors. Writing locally in VS Code with
  full git history is compelling for developer audiences.

  ---
  Reader Experience & Discovery

  Table stakes:
  - Responsive design (mobile-first)
  - Fast page loads (<2 seconds)
  - Dark mode toggle
  - SEO fundamentals (meta tags, OpenGraph, sitemap)
  - Social sharing metadata (Twitter cards, OpenGraph)

  Differentiators:
  - Table of contents auto-generated from headings
  - Code block enhancements (copy button, line numbers)
  - Privacy-first analytics (Plausible/Simple Analytics)
  - Search functionality (client-side with pagefind/lunr.js)

  Research notes: Dark mode is now table stakes. SEO configuration must be done
  before launch—changing URLs later damages rankings.

  ---
  Portfolio Features

  Table stakes:
  - Projects showcase (grid with 3-5 featured projects)
  - About page with bio and photo
  - Contact form with validation

  Differentiators:
  - Project case studies (deep dives, markdown-based like posts)
  - Tech stack visualization for each project
  - GitHub repo integration (stars, last updated)

  Research notes: Portfolio integration is unique. Most platforms do blog OR
  portfolio, not both. This creates professional presence value.

  ---
  Engagement Features

  Table stakes:
  - Comments on articles
  - Reactions/likes on posts

  Differentiators:
  - Comment moderation dashboard
  - Popular posts widget based on analytics
  - Newsletter integration (Buttondown, ConvertKit)

  Research notes: Two paths for comments: (1) Self-host with
  lakm/laravel-comments—full control, needs spam protection; (2) Use Giscus
  (GitHub Discussions)—outsourced, less maintenance. Analytics should be
  privacy-first for GDPR compliance.

  Now let me ask which features you want in v1:
