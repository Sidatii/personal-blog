### Anti-Features (Commonly Requested, Often Problematic)

Features that seem good but create problems. Things to deliberately NOT build.

| Anti-Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Content Management** | | | |
| Visual/WYSIWYG editor | Non-technical ease of use | Breaks git-first promise; adds complexity for developer audience | Embrace markdown; developer audience prefers it |
| In-browser editing | "GitHub is too complicated" | Adds database, authentication, defeats static benefits | Use VS Code locally; that's the target workflow |
| Multiple author workflows | "What if I collaborate?" | Authentication, permissions, approval flows | Git handles this - PRs are the workflow |
| **Engagement** | | | |
| Built-in comments system | "Keep everything in one place" | Spam management, moderation, database, hosting costs | Use Giscus (GitHub Discussions) or Utterances |
| Real-time everything | "Make it feel alive" | WebSockets, servers, complexity without value | Static + periodic rebuilds is the strength |
| User accounts & profiles | "Build community features" | Authentication, database, privacy concerns, scope creep | Focus on content; social features live on Twitter/GitHub |
| **Features Bloat** | | | |
| Page builder / drag-drop | "Make design easy" | Interface bloat, priority failure, defeats markdown simplicity | Use themes with clear layouts; focus on content |
| Excessive customization | "Every user is different" | Decision paralysis, testing burden, maintenance hell | Opinionated defaults with minimal config |
| Analytics overload | "Track everything" | Privacy concerns, slow pages, analysis paralysis | One simple, privacy-first tool with key metrics only |
| Plugin/extension system | "Make it extensible" | API surface area, breaking changes, maintenance burden | Start with core features; extend later if needed |
| **Portfolio Anti-Patterns** | | | |
| Complexity demos | "Show off everything I know" | Overwhelming, slow, defeats simplicity | Curate best 3-5 projects; quality over quantity |
| Animation overload | "Make it stand out" | Slow loading, accessibility issues, distracting | Subtle, purposeful animations only |
| Template kitchen sink | "Provide all possible sections" | Bloated, generic look, decision fatigue | Minimal, focused template; let content shine |
| **Technical** | | | |
| SPA/Client-side routing | "Modern feel" | Unnecessary complexity for content site | Static HTML is faster; progressive enhancement |
| Serverless functions everywhere | "Scale infinitely" | Debugging difficulty, cost, overkill for static blog | Reserve for actual needs (contact form, analytics) |
| Docker/K8s deployment | "Production-ready infrastructure" | Over-engineering for static files | Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages handles this |

### Dependency Notes

- **Git-based workflow is foundational**: Nearly all features assume git as source of truth
- **Giscus requires GitHub**: Comments feature locks into GitHub ecosystem (acceptable trade-off)
- **MDX adds significant complexity**: Only add if interactive components are essential
- **Analytics should be added early**: Informs content strategy decisions
- **Image optimization in build**: Not runtime - keeps hosting simple

## MVP Definition

### Launch With (v1)

Minimum viable product — what's needed to validate: "Can I publish developer content via git and build an audience?"

**Content Publishing (Core Loop):**
- [x] Markdown writing & publishing (push to git = publish)
- [x] Post listing (reverse chronological)
- [x] Individual post pages (clean reading experience)
- [x] Categories & tags (basic taxonomy)
- [x] RSS/Atom feed (for RSS readers)
- [x] Push-to-deploy automation (GitHub Actions)

**Reading Experience (Table Stakes):**
- [x] Responsive design (mobile-first)
- [x] Fast page loads (<2s, static sites excel here)
- [x] Syntax highlighting for code (Shiki/Prism)
- [x] Dark mode (developer preference)

**Portfolio Presence (Professional Value):**
- [x] Projects showcase (grid with 3-5 featured projects)
- [x] About page (bio, photo, background)
- [x] Contact form/info (email or simple form)

**Discovery (Growth Channel):**
- [x] SEO fundamentals (meta tags, OpenGraph, sitemap)
- [x] Social sharing metadata (OpenGraph, Twitter cards)

**Rationale:** These features enable the core loop: write markdown → push to git → publish → readers discover → professional presence. Validates the git-based publishing promise and portfolio value.

### Add After Validation (v1.x)

Features to add once core is working and audience is growing.

**Enhanced Engagement (when readers exist):**
- [ ] Comments via Giscus — *Trigger: 10+ posts, consistent traffic*
- [ ] Newsletter integration — *Trigger: readers asking for email updates*
- [ ] Webmentions — *Trigger: content being shared elsewhere*

**Content Enhancement (when library grows):**
- [ ] Search functionality — *Trigger: 20+ posts published*
- [ ] Table of contents (auto) — *Trigger: writing longer form content (>2000 words)*
- [ ] Series/collections — *Trigger: multiple related posts exist*

**Writer Insights (inform strategy):**
- [ ] Privacy-first analytics — *Trigger: post-launch to understand traffic*
- [ ] Popular posts widget — *Trigger: enough data to show trends*
- [ ] Reading stats dashboard — *Trigger: analytics established*

**Portfolio Depth (as projects accumulate):**
- [ ] Project case studies — *Trigger: 3+ significant projects to showcase*
- [ ] Tech stack visualization — *Trigger: diverse project portfolio*
- [ ] Resume/CV download — *Trigger: job search begins*

**Rationale:** These enhance the core experience but aren't needed to validate the concept. Add based on usage signals and content volume.

### Future Consideration (v2+)

Features to defer until product-market fit is established and clear user demand exists.

**Advanced Content:**
- [ ] MDX support — *Why defer: High complexity; validate if interactive components needed*
- [ ] Code playground embedding — *Why defer: Easy to add; wait for use cases*
- [ ] Image optimization (auto) — *Why defer: Manual optimization sufficient at low volume*

**Advanced Engagement:**
- [ ] Reactions (simple) — *Why defer: Comments may be sufficient; test engagement first*
- [ ] Author reply indicators — *Why defer: Low priority until consistent commenting*

**Advanced Portfolio:**
- [ ] Project filtering/sorting — *Why defer: Only needed with 10+ projects*
- [ ] Testimonials section — *Why defer: Need testimonials first*

**Technical Optimization:**
- [ ] Incremental builds — *Why defer: Full builds fast enough initially*
- [ ] Edge functions — *Why defer: Static serving sufficient; add only if needed*

**Rationale:** These features may never be needed, or demand will be clear from user behavior. Don't build speculatively.

- **P3: Nice to have, future consideration** — Defer until clear demand or PMF

## Competitor Feature Analysis

| Feature | Ghost (2026) | Dev.to | Hashnode | Our Approach (Git-First) |
|---------|--------------|--------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Publishing** | Web editor + API | Web editor | Web editor | Local markdown + git push (differentiator) |
| **Hosting** | Managed hosting | Free hosted | Free hosted | Self-deploy to Vercel/Netlify/Pages |
| **Pricing** | $9-29/mo | Free | Free | Free (own your platform) |
| **Comments** | Built-in + Disqus | Native | Native | Giscus (GitHub Discussions) |
| **Newsletter** | Built-in (Ghost) | No | Built-in | Third-party integration |
| **Analytics** | Built-in | Basic stats | Built-in | Plausible/Simple (privacy-first) |
| **Code Highlighting** | Basic | Good | Good | Excellent (Shiki, matches VS Code) |
| **Dark Mode** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (designed for developers) |
| **Portfolio** | No | No | Limited | Yes (core feature) |
| **Customization** | Themes + code | Limited | Themes | Full control (own the code) |
| **Data Ownership** | Export available | Locked in | Export available | Full ownership (git repo is source) |
| **SEO Control** | Good | Limited | Good | Full control |

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Git-native workflow**: Ghost/Dev.to/Hashnode use web editors. We use local markdown + git. Developer-native.
2. **Full ownership**: Competitors host your data. We give you the code and repo. Export isn't needed - you already own it.
3. **Portfolio integration**: Ghost is blog-only. Dev.to/Hashnode lack portfolio features. We combine blog + portfolio.
4. **Zero hosting costs**: Competitors charge or show ads. Static sites deploy free to Vercel/Netlify/Pages.
5. **Developer UX**: Competitors serve general audience. We optimize for developers (code highlighting, dark mode, git workflow).

**Where competitors win:**
- **Ease of use**: Web editors are simpler for non-developers
- **Built-in community**: Dev.to/Hashnode have existing audiences
- **Managed hosting**: Ghost handles server management
- **All-in-one**: Ghost includes email, analytics, membership in one package

**Our trade-offs (acceptable for target audience):**
- Require git/markdown knowledge (but target is developers)
- No built-in community (but leverage Twitter/GitHub/LinkedIn for distribution)
- Self-deploy required (but Vercel/Netlify make this trivial)
- Integration work (but gives flexibility and avoids lock-in)

## Git-Based Workflow Implications

### Unique Affordances

Features enabled by git-based workflow:

1. **Version control is native**: Post history, rollbacks, branching for drafts — all free from git
2. **Collaboration via PRs**: Guest posts, edits, corrections use standard dev workflow
3. **CI/CD for content**: Automated checks (spell check, link validation, frontmatter validation)
4. **Local development**: Write offline, preview locally, no internet required
5. **Tooling integration**: Use existing dev tools (VS Code, linters, formatters)
6. **Backup by default**: Distributed git repos = automatic backups
7. **Open source friendly**: Easy to share templates, contribute improvements

### Workflow Constraints

Features that conflict with git-first approach:

1. **No real-time collaboration**: Markdown files = one editor at a time (acceptable)
2. **No WYSIWYG**: Must understand markdown (target audience does)
3. **Technical barrier**: Requires git knowledge (but target is developers)
4. **Build time**: Changes require rebuild (but under 1 minute is fine)
5. **No dynamic content**: Everything is pre-built (use client-side JS where needed)

### Features to Emphasize

Based on git-native workflow:

- **Draft branches**: Use git branches for work-in-progress posts
- **Commit messages as changelog**: Show content evolution
- **Frontmatter validation**: Pre-commit hooks catch errors
- **Local preview**: `npm run dev` for instant feedback
- **Auto-deploy on merge**: Push to main = instant publish
- **Content history**: View post evolution in git log
