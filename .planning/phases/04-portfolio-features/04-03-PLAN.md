<objective>
Build the About page with bio sections, profile photo placeholder, skills visualization, and categorized tech stack badges with tooltips.

Purpose: Give visitors a personal connection with the author through a well-structured About page. The tech stack visualization on this page (as decided by user) shows expertise in a scannable format with categorized badges.

Output: AboutController, About page view with section-based layout, reusable tech stack badges component, and portfolio config file for skills data.

    The config file serves as a simple editable data source. The user customizes values directly in this file -- no admin UI needed.

    Create AboutController:
    - index(Request $request): View
      - Load portfolio config: config('portfolio')
      - Build SEO data: title "About", description from bio intro
      - Pass $portfolio and $seo to view

    Add route to web.php (in the Portfolio Routes section, alongside project routes):
    - GET /about -> AboutController@index, name 'about'
    - Note: The header already links to /about, so this route must match that existing link.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `php artisan route:list --name=about` to confirm route registered.
    Run `php artisan config:clear` then `php artisan tinker --execute="print_r(array_keys(config('portfolio.tech_stack')));"` to confirm config loads with correct categories.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Portfolio config file exists with structured tech_stack data grouped by category.
    AboutController loads config and passes to view.
    /about route is registered and matches existing header link.
  </done>

  <files>
    resources/views/about/index.blade.php
    resources/views/components/tech-stack-badges.blade.php
  </files>
  <action>
    Create tech-stack-badges.blade.php component:
    - Accept $categories prop (the tech_stack array from config)
    - Loop through each category (Languages, Frameworks, etc.)
    - Category heading: text-lg font-semibold text-rose-pine-text mb-3
    - Badges in flex-wrap row with gap-2
    - Each badge: inline-flex items-center px-3 py-1.5 rounded-full text-sm font-medium
    - Badge colors per category using Rose Pine palette:
      - Languages: bg-rose-pine-foam/15 text-rose-pine-foam border border-rose-pine-foam/30
      - Frameworks & Libraries: bg-rose-pine-iris/15 text-rose-pine-iris border border-rose-pine-iris/30
      - Tools & Platforms: bg-rose-pine-gold/15 text-rose-pine-gold border border-rose-pine-gold/30
      - Specializations: bg-rose-pine-love/15 text-rose-pine-love border border-rose-pine-love/30
    - Tooltip on hover using Alpine.js x-data and @mouseenter/@mouseleave:
      - Small absolute positioned tooltip above badge
      - Shows the 'note' field (e.g., "5+ years")
      - bg-rose-pine-overlay text-rose-pine-text text-xs px-2 py-1 rounded shadow-lg
      - Transition: x-show with opacity animation
    - If a category has no items, skip it

    Create about/index.blade.php:
    - Extends layouts.app
    - Max width container (max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4) matching blog layout
    - Section 1 - Hero/Bio:
      - Two-column layout on desktop (md:flex), stacked on mobile
      - Left: Profile photo placeholder (if config photo is null, show a styled placeholder div with initials or generic icon, w-48 h-48 rounded-full bg-rose-pine-surface border-2 border-rose-pine-overlay)
      - Right: Name (text-3xl font-bold), title/role (text-xl text-rose-pine-iris), intro paragraph (text-rose-pine-subtle leading-relaxed)
      - Extended bio below in full width (mt-8, prose-like formatting)
    - Section 2 - Skills & Expertise:
      - Section heading: text-2xl font-bold text-rose-pine-text
      - Include tech-stack-badges component passing config('portfolio.tech_stack')
      - Spacing between categories: space-y-6
    - Section 3 - Interests & Hobbies:
      - Section heading: text-2xl font-bold text-rose-pine-text
      - Simple list or tag-style display of interests from config
      - Styled as subtle pills: bg-rose-pine-surface text-rose-pine-subtle px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-sm
    - All sections separated by: py-12 border-b border-rose-pine-overlay (except last)
    - Uses $seo passed from controller for SEO meta

    Run `php artisan view:cache` to confirm views compile, then `php artisan view:clear`.
    Visit http://localhost:8000/about - page loads with all three sections visible.
    Hover over a tech stack badge to confirm tooltip appears with note text.
    Check responsive: verify layout stacks on narrow viewport.

  <done>
    /about page displays three sections: Bio/Photo, Skills with categorized badges, and Interests.
    Tech stack badges show color-coded categories with hover tooltips via Alpine.js.
    Layout is responsive: two-column bio on desktop, stacked on mobile.
    All styling uses Rose Pine theme colors.
