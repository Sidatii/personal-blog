<objective>
Update site navigation to include all portfolio pages and create seed data for testing the projects showcase.

Purpose: Wire the entire portfolio into the site navigation so visitors can discover projects, about, and contact pages. Seed data allows verification of the masonry grid, status filters, and project detail pages with realistic content.

Output: Updated header and footer with portfolio links, ProjectSeeder with sample projects, and visual verification of the complete portfolio feature set.

    Include varied short_description lengths so masonry layout shows height variation (some 1 line, some 2-3 lines).

    Register ProjectSeeder in DatabaseSeeder.php:
    - Add `$this->call([ProjectSeeder::class]);` in the run() method
    - Keep any existing seeders in the array

    Run the seeder: `php artisan db:seed --class=ProjectSeeder`
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `php artisan db:seed --class=ProjectSeeder` without errors.
    Run `php artisan tinker --execute="\App\Models\Project::count();"` confirms 6 projects.
    Run `php artisan tinker --execute="\App\Models\Project::where('status','active')->count();"` confirms 2 active projects.
    Visit http://localhost:8000/projects and confirm masonry grid shows all 6 projects.
    Click status filter buttons to confirm filtering works.
    Click a project card to confirm detail page loads.

    6 sample projects seeded with varied statuses (2 active, 2 completed, 1 in-progress, 1 archived).
    Projects appear in masonry grid at /projects with varied card heights.
